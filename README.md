# Tree Story

Tree Story is the story of a party, an enormous party, where many overlapping stories affect one
another in complex ways. There is no way to see the whole game in one playthrough; you'll have to
play again and make different friends and enemies the second time, and the third time, if you want
to hear everything it has to say.

In theory.

It has some interesting innovations, including a custom class that functions like a Python dictionary but limits the acceptable values, sort of like an enumerated-type-meets-python-dict mashup.
